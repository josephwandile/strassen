> Optimizing Strassen's Algorithm for Matrix Multiplication

## Analysis

* All timing data is generated with format `[strassen|traditional]_[smallest_dim]_[largest_dim]_[trials_per_dim]` and is found in the root directory.

## Style Rules

* `thisIsAFunction`
* `this_is_a_variable`
* Separate functions by two lines
* Block off logical sections of code with descriptive comments
* `pointer*`, rather than `pointer *`
* When writing code which has different behavior for Strassen's vs. traditional multiplication use the variable `bool using_strassen`
